        <h1>Main Section</h1>
            <p>Since the inception of the Guild Advancement Program (GAP) in 2022, YGG players have been uncovering opportunities to be rewarded for their contributions to the ecosystem and build their onchain reputation as they complete quests together. Especially during the Crypto Winter, the GAP was something for players to get excited about. It was a shared experience for the community, strengthening bonds while everyone grinded and leveled up toward a common goal.

                As the GAP consistently introduced new games, innovated on quest design, and rewarded diligent players, it became key to sustaining community engagement during an otherwise quiet period for the industry. GAP Season 4 saw incredible growth, with 6,184 YGG account sign-ups (147% increase from GAP Season 3) and 33,681 quest enrollments (243% increase) across games such as Axie Infinity, Pixels, Star Atlas, GensoKishi Online, Champions Ascension, and many others.
                
                Anticipation has been building in the months leading up to the launch of GAP Season 5. Taking lessons learned from the past four seasons, GAP Season 5 is adopting a more streamlined approach while challenging players with more quests than ever before. As a new wave of titles goes live in the near future, GAP Season 5 is set to kick off another exciting summer for web3 gaming.</p>

            <p>GAP Season 5 players will quest through a two-part season, which introduces YGG points, premium quests and bounties to create a more immersive and tailored program.

                “One of the goals the team has for GAP Season 5 is to actively oversee the progression of players and game partners,” said Mark Tan, YGG Head of Community. “YGG points and the new schedule are a few ways we’ll be able to do that this season. We’ve also added quest-specific guides and FAQs that new players can access. There’s a lot of flexibility and potential for the future with these changes as the foundation.”</p>
